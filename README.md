## A Practical Ecommerce project

In this project I developed a store where you can add products to the cart, using Strapi as a backend.

Throughout the app there is cart drawer listing all the products the user wish to order. 
From inside the drawer, the quantity of products can be upgraded and downgraded.

There is a payment gateway that summaries the orders, which will be generated and can be deleted any order at any time.
It's possible to buy products, but it does not have a payment platform system, it's only simulated.
There is also a complete admin panel from Strapi, a category system created with dynamic routing, and an order list after the payment gateway.
