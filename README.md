## An Practical Ecommerce project. 

In this project developed an store where you can add products to the cart using Strapi as a backend.
Throughout the app there is cart drawer listing all the products the user wish to order. 
From inside the drawer, the quantity of products can be upgraded and downgraded.
There is a payment gateway where we there is a order summary that will be generated and we can delete any order at any time.
It's possible to buy products, but it does not have a payment platform system, it's only simulated.
There is also a category system created witih dynamic routing, a complete admin panel from Strapi and an order list after the payment gateway.
