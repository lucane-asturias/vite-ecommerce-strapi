## A Practical Ecommerce project

In this project I developed a example ecommerce where you can add products to the cart and order the product.

It's a learning project, so I took the opportunity to use Vuetify to further learn more about the framework
while using Strapi as a backend server, with the assistance of the course instructor, which I had never used before.

Throughout the app there is cart drawer listing all the products the user wish to order. 
From inside the drawer, the quantity of products can be upgraded and downgraded.

There is a payment gateway that summaries the orders, which will be generated. A specific order can be deleted at any time.
It's possible to buy products, but it does not have a payment platform system, it's only simulated.
There is also a complete admin panel from Strapi, a category system created with dynamic routing, and an order list after the payment gateway.
